I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University and part of the Interactive Robotics Lab. 
After majoring in engineering with a strong focus on robotics, I worked as a mechatronics engineer 
at a robotics startup (SpringActive), where I designed software and hardware for state-of-the-art assistive devices. 
In my 10 years of engineering experience, I learned to be ambitious in how I approach 
problems while developing intelligent control systems which enable 
amputees to walk, run, and jump seamlessly. My work allowed me to see firsthand that classical control 
formulations are simply not powerful enough to drive the next generation of intelligent robotics and drove me 
to pursue a Ph.D. in machine learning.</p>
<!-- to work in multidisciplinary teams and  -->

<p>My research focuses on agile locomotion for legged robotics. Both assistive devices and legged robots share 
  many of the same challenges, including how to best perceive the world and control robots based on those perceptions.
  My research focuses primarily on adding <b>Bayesian filtering</b> and <b>optimal control</b> concepts to 
  <b>probabilistic machine learning</b> paradigms to produce robust and agile actions. See my research section
  for my specific applications.</p>

<p>I believe strongly in a work-life balance and a revolving selection of personal projects. In my free time, I 
  enjoy reading (or listening to audiobooks) and playing the piano. I have two wonderful dogs I love 
  to spend time with while hiking, camping, and hunting, or even letting them laze around while I work on 
  my house. The last of my hobbies which I will mention here is film photography; I have a 35mm Olympus film 
  camera which I dutifully take on all my adventures with my wife and son.</p>
