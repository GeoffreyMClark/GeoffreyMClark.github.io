[Desert WAVE](https://www.desertwave.us/) (Women in Autonimous Vehicle Engineering) is a robotics group based in Phoenix, AZ, whos mission is to provide a supportive and engaging environment where female engineering students can come together to grow and accomplish amazing things. We prepare our members with interpersonal, professional, and real-world technical skills necessary to excel in their studies and careers. In particular I worked with a ground of students to for the Machine Learning team in which i taught them how to collect data, design a data pipeline, finetune the mobilenet SSD model on their data, and finally to utalize their fully trained model on the autonimous robot with openCV.
