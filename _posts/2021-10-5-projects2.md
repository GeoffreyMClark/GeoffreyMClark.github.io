[Desert WAVE](https://www.desertwave.us/) (Women in Autonomous Vehicle Engineering) is a robotics group based in Phoenix, AZ, whose mission is to provide a supportive and engaging environment where female engineering students can come together to grow and accomplish amazing things. We prepare our members with interpersonal, professional, and real-world technical skills necessary to excel in their studies and careers. In particular, I taught a group of students on the Machine Learning team. I instructed them on how to collect data, design a data pipeline, finetune the MobileNet-SSD2 model on their data, and finally, utilize their fully trained model on the autonomous robot with OpenCV.
