Walking is a critical motor skill which is at the center of human mobility and independence.  However, for many millions of people affected by musculoskeletal disorders, amputations, neurologic pathologies, or other health-related issues walking may be a daily struggle or even completely out of reach. Modern assistive robotics technology has the potential to change the lives of  people affected by such conditions for the better

Healthy human adults on average walk several thousand steps per day, seemingly without any effort and with substantial grace and fluency to their movements. In doing so, they repeatedly perform variations of the same periodic behavior, adapting it in each moment to the state of their body and the conditions of their environment. By taking a behavioural cloning approach, we are able to learn complex and imformative models of human locomtion. These models translate directly into prosthesis contol commands for our powered prosthetic device. Our models, much like humans themselfes, constantly adapt and interract with the user as they walk, run, jump, or climb stairs.
