Walking is a critical motor skill which is at the center of human mobility and independence.  However, for many millions of people affected by musculoskeletal disorders, amputations, neurologic pathologies, or other health-related issues walking may be a daily struggle or even completely out of reach. Modern assistive robotics technology has the potential to change the lives of  people affected by such conditions for the better

Healthy human adults on average walk several thousand steps per day, seemingly without any effort and with substantial grace and fluency to their movements. In doing so, they repeatedly perform variations of the same periodic behavior, adapting it in each moment to the state of their body and the conditions of their environment. By taking a behavioural cloning approach, we are able to learn complex and imformative models of human locomtion. These models translate directly into prosthesis contol commands for our powered prosthetic device. Our models, much like humans themselves, constantly adapt and interract with the user as they walk, run, jump, or climb stairs.

One remaining problem, however, was that machine learning models learn from the data given to them, but out of context. It is very easy therefore to trick them into actions outside of their operating parameters. To solve this problem we implimented an aditional optimization step into our learning feamework which specifically targets datapoints which exceed specific constraints. In this way we can build models that are both addaptive and safe.

We are in the late stages of tesing our methods on amputees and how to have new data to show soon.
