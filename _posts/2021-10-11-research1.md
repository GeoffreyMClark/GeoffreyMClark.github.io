Walking is a critical motor skill which is at the center of human mobility and independence.  However, for many millions of people affected by musculoskeletal disorders, amputations, neurologic pathologies, or other health-related issues walking may be a daily struggle or even completely out of reach. Modern assistive robotics technology has the potential to change the lives of people affected by such conditions for the better.

Healthy human adults on average walk several thousand steps per day, seemingly without any effort and with substantial grace and fluency to their movements. In doing so, they repeatedly perform variations of the same periodic behavior, adapting it in each moment to the state of their body and the conditions of their environment. By taking a behavioural cloning approach, we are able to learn complex and imformative models of human locomtion. These models translate directly into prosthesis contol commands for our powered prosthetic device. Our models, much like humans themselves, constantly adapt and interract with the user as they walk, run, jump, or climb stairs. I incorperated a multitude of body-worn sensors which include inertial measurements of each limb, force measurements from instrumented insoles, and camera sensors able to discern the local environment. My work shows that probabilistic models can easily conceptualize the controls necessary to react quickly and effectively to changes in human movement and enviroment.

One remaining problem, however, is that machine learning models learn from the data given to them, but out of context. It is very easy therefore to trick them into actions outside of their operating parameters. These adversarial samples can come both naturally through sensor or data errors, or unnaturally through nerfarious attacks on the prosthesis software. In response to this problem, we implimented an aditional optimization step into our learning framework which specifically targets datapoints which exceed specific constraints. In laymens terms we can set hard constraints on the control outputs such as torque, velocity, or position, and optimize the models for both accuracy and constraint satisfaction. In this way we can build models that are both adaptive and safe.

We are in the late stages of tesing our methods on amputees and expect to have new data to show soon.
