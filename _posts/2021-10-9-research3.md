In order to make prosthetics more responsive to the environment we needed a new modality that can sense environmental factors before they happen. We settled upon adding a small camera to the prosthetic which is able to see the ground in the immediate vicinity of the users foot. Using this new modality, as a user approaches stairs or a curb the prosthesis can automatically adjust to ensure the subject does not trip and that the optimal control action is taken. In the save vein small but important changes to the control action are nessary to adjust the gait when the user walks over, grass, sand, or gravel. Our method enables a user to seemlessly transition between terrain types while retaining control over their actions.
