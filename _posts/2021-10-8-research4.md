I applied reinforcement learning to the task of bimanual manipulation of thrown objects. Using [sparse latent space policy search](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12275/11822) I learned complex bimanual policies capable of picking up and throwing soft balls into hoops ranging from 0.5m to 2.5m from the robot. Bimanual control policies are difficult to learn using reinforcement learning because if a single one of the 12 degrees of freedom is out of sync with the others there is little to no reward. We overcame this problem by projecting the robots control actions (dynamic movement primitives) into a latent space which we can easily optimize even with sparse rewards. While competing solutions required thousands to learn a usefull policy, the method I applied achieved success in less than 300 trials, taking only an hour. All of the learning was done on the physical robot, while we utalized a microsoft kinnect to track the ball in realtime and determine if the throw was a success.
