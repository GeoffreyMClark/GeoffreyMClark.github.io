In my time at [SpringActive](https://springactive.com/) I helped develop an intelligent, powered ankle prosthesis called the Ruggedized Odyssey ankle. This robotic prosthesis provides the user with a fully-powered and properly timed push-off, picks the toe up in the swing phasem and provides a natural and energy efficient gait to amputees. Additionally, the prosthesis was both mechanically and chemically waterproofed to the IPX7 standard, for fully submerged use. A compliant actuator stores the natural braking energy from the stride, while a small lightweight motor adds additional energy to each step. The prosthesis is, therefore, capable of fully-powered walking and running. And is still the only prosthetic ankle to demonstrate fully powered walking and running while completely submerged in water, over uneven terrain, and in unconstrained environments.

My contribution focused around the electronics and and control system design and selection, as well as the creation of software for the user interface and data collection. The prosthesis utalized a 9 degree of freedom inertial measurement unit and magnetic encoder on the ankle joint to ditermint the state of the human-robot system. A PID based phase controller calculates motor torque which are sent to our motor module over CAN. Coding was done with realtime MatLab and embedded C.
