I designed and machined the entire frame and waterproof housing for the movie used remote underwater vehicle (ROV), representing the school Cornell in the movie [Spare Parts](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3233418/). I built working sensor packs, designed a controller, and fabricated a waterproof housing.
