I designed and machined the entire frame and waterproof housing for the movie used remote underwater vehicle (ROV), representing the school Cornell in the film [Spare Parts](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3233418/). I built working sensor packs, designed a controller, and fabricated a waterproof housing. We modified bilge pump motors for each of the thrusters, which were controlled by independent speed controllers commanded by a raspberry pi with the assistance of two cameras to transmit video data back to the controller. Lastly, I designed and fabricated the gripper and temperature probe to interact with the underwater tasks. I am listed on the [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3233418/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cl_sm) page under robot design/fabrication.
