One of the most important challenges for assistive devices is finding what we call the Goldilocks control signals. Too much, or too little force at the wrong time easily builds up to cause long term musculoskeletal degeneration, such as ostroarthritis. In fact users of modern prosthetics are at a severe risk of secondary musculoskeletal conditions due to their prosthetics being even slightly missaligned. It is of upmost importance, therfore, to produce safe and ergonomic control policies which take into account the potential biomechanical load the control policy places on the user.

By first utalizing predictive models to anticipate the users actions we can select the best control action for long term health and ergonomics. I constructed a novel model predictive control formulation which optimizes the control policy in real-time utalizing a probabilistic formulation. We show a significant reduction in joint impacts in both normal walking and vertical jumping which using our controller, and a 20X reduction in the effects of perturbations.

Notably this work combines novel ML models with classical optimal control methods for both prediction and human-centered control. If you are interested in trying our our methods you can find code and examples on our [github](https://github.com/ir-lab/intprim).
