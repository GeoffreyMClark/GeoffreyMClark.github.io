One of the most important challenges for assistive devices is finding the Goldilocks control. Too much, or too little force at the wrong time easily builds up to cause long term musculoskeletal degeneration, such as ostroarthritis. By utalizing predictive models to anticipate the users actions we can select the best control action for long term health and ergonomics. We show a significant reduction in joint impacts in both normal walking and vertical jumping, and a 20X reduction in the effects of perturbations to the subject.

Notably this work combines novel ML models with classical optimal control methods for both prediction and human-centered control.
