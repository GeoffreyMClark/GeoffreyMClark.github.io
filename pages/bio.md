I am a PhD student at Arizona State University and part of the Interactive Robotics Labor. After majoring in engineering with a strong focus on robotics, I proceeded to work as a mechatronics engineer at a small startup (SpringActive) where I had the chance to R&D both software and hardware for state of the art lower limb prosthetic devices. In my 10 years engineering experience, I learned to work in multidisciplinary teams and to be ambitious in how I approach problems while developing intelligent control systems which enable amputees to walk, run, and jump, seamlessly. My work allowed me to see first hand that classical control formulations are simply not powerful enough to drive the next generation of intelligent robotics, and gained a strong foundation robtics imparative to the application of machine learning methods on robotic systems. 

I believe strongly in a work life balance and a revolving selection of personal projects. In my free time I enjoy reading (or listening to an audiobook) and playing the piano. I have two wonderfull dogs that I love to spend time with while hiking, camping, and hunting, or even just letting them laze around while I work on my house or my 1981 Honda CB750 motorcycle --- that needs too much work to get running again. The last of my hobbies which I will mention here is film photography, I have a 35mm Olympus film camera which I dutifully take on all my adventures.
